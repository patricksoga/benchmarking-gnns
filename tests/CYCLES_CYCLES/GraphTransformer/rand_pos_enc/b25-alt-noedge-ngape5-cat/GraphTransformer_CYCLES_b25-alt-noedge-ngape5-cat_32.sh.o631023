/afs/crc.nd.edu/user/p/psoga/benchmarking-gnns/main_CYCLES_graph_classification.py:319: FutureWarning: The input object of type 'Tensor' is an array-like implementing one of the corresponding protocols (`__array__`, `__array_interface__` or `__array_struct__`); but not a sequence (or 0-D). In the future, this object will be coerced as if it was first converted using `np.array(obj)`. To retain the old behaviour, you have to either modify the type 'Tensor', or assign to an empty array created with `np.empty(correct_shape, dtype=object)`.
  num_classes = len(np.unique(np.array(dataset.train[:][1])))
/afs/crc.nd.edu/user/p/psoga/benchmarking-gnns/main_CYCLES_graph_classification.py:319: VisibleDeprecationWarning: Creating an ndarray from ragged nested sequences (which is a list-or-tuple of lists-or-tuples-or ndarrays with different lengths or shapes) is deprecated. If you meant to do this, you must specify 'dtype=object' when creating the ndarray.
