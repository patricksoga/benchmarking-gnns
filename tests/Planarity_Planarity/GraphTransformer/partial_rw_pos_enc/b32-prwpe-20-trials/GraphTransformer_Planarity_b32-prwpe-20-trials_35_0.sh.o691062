/afs/crc.nd.edu/user/p/psoga/benchmarking-gnns/main_Planarity_graph_classification.py:292: FutureWarning: The input object of type 'Tensor' is an array-like implementing one of the corresponding protocols (`__array__`, `__array_interface__` or `__array_struct__`); but not a sequence (or 0-D). In the future, this object will be coerced as if it was first converted using `np.array(obj)`. To retain the old behaviour, you have to either modify the type 'Tensor', or assign to an empty array created with `np.empty(correct_shape, dtype=object)`.

If you meant to do this, you must specify 'dtype=object' when creating the ndarray.
